# LoginRadius Front End portion

Since I was given two templates, the end product is best optimized for 320px and 1440px width.
Some parts of the screen are not optimized for widths other than 320px and 1440px. However, it does not mean that I am not capable of developing more responsive design that supports more widths. I can create create more versions of the website upon demands whether through pure css or using bootstrap.
